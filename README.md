A stereo High-End preamplifier with many options.

This is the final version of many prototypes I maded in the past. It's a fantastic sounding preamplifier, totally analog that works at high voltage by using 2 stage hybrid transistor/mosfet modules as active amplification, high end Lundahln transformers in each in/out and a controllable saturation double triode stage that works in series/parallel for adding harmonics. All signal path it's fully analog, really very low noise but it's all controlled by a microprocessor so I add the best of analog and digital worlds.
The digital section it's totally separated by analog side, even grounds are separated, all connections are maded by optocouplers.
Power supply uses many stages with different transformers, 3 stage lowpass filters (that uses a lot of capacitors), ultra fast scottky diodes and super LDO's by Linear Technology and a 3 stage main supply filter and are designed for the most possible low impedance possible for maximum ripple rejection.
Microphone inputs have variable impedance to adapt every type of mike and has a separate instrument input for guitar and a line input all with transformers.
It's really heavy because it's full of heavy stuff so I used an heavy box maded by using 1cm to 5mm navy alluminium.
